      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our project &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydraulic transients in water distribution systems – the role of unsteady friction and groundwater contamination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has been awarded a 1-year research grant from 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.doi.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;U.S. Department of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://water.usgs.gov/wrri/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Water Resources Research Act Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project develops a risk assessment tool to evaluate the health risks associated with contaminated water intrusions in distribution systems caused by hydraulic transients. This work is motivated by the increasing demands for drinking water supply due to population and city growth. In turn, this leads to expansion of existing pipeline networks with more connections and flow control structures. Performance optimization of such complex networks involves non-trivial control procedures that can generate significant hydraulic transient events propagating in all parts of the system. One potential public health consequence is the intrusion of sewage-contaminated groundwater into the pipeline at pipe leaks caused by negative pressure surges. Because transients occur over short timescales, source tracing after an event is improbable, if not impossible at all; the high contaminant concentrations that lead to human illnesses has already been flushed downstream. Thus, a predictive model must be used to assess the associated health risks. This proposed research consists of two phases. In the first phase, we critically re-examine 1D unsteady friction models and the orifice equation for modeling leakage using detailed experiments. The experimental setup is a reservoir-pipe-valve system that provides optical access for particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements. In the second phase, we couple a hydraulic transient model to the advective-diffusion-reaction equation for the monitoring of contaminant (e.g., heavy metals and pathogens) intrusions into pipelines due to suction at leaks. Combining the predicted contaminant concentrations with dosage-response studies and human water consumption behaviors, we construct risk maps for an illustrative water distribution system that show likelihood of consumers falling ill due to the usage of contaminated drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;http://research.gatech.edu/gt-community/funding-opportunities/gt-annual-seed-grant&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Small Bets Seed Grant 2020&lt;/a&gt;. This is a collaboration with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://eas.gatech.edu/people/robel-dr-alexander&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr. Alexander Robel&lt;/a&gt; from the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech. We are excited!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a synopsis-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melt from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are increasingly contributing to ongoing global sea level rise. This ice sheet mass loss is primarily driven by the thinning, retreat and acceleration of glaciers in contact with the ocean. Observations from the field and remote-sensing platforms indicates that glaciers are sensitive to changes at the ice-ocean interface and that the increase in submarine melting is likely to be driven by the discharge of meltwater from underneath the glacier (known as subglacial meltwater plumes). The melting of glacier ice also directly inputs a large volume of freshwater into the ocean, potentially causing significant changes in the circulation of ocean waters which regulate the transport of heat on Earth, making ice-ocean interactions an important potential amplifier in climate change and variability. Our ability to predict, and hence adequately response to, climate change and sea level rise therefore depends on our knowledge of the small-scale processes occurring in the vicinity of subglacial meltwater plumes at the ice-ocean interface. Currently, our understanding of the underlying physics is incomplete; for example, different parameterizations of the glacial-ocean interaction could yield melting rates that vary over a factor of five for the same heat supply from the ocean. It is then very difficult to ascertain and judge the reliability of predictive models. We propose to use laboratory experiments to study how the melt rates of glaciers in the vicinity of plumes are affected by the ice roughness, ice geometry, and ocean turbulence at the ice-ocean interface.&lt;/p&gt;
