This is a collaboration with Dr. Alexander Robel from the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech. We are excited!\nHere is a synopsis-\nMelt from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are increasingly contributing to ongoing global sea level rise. This ice sheet mass loss is primarily driven by the thinning, retreat and acceleration of glaciers in contact with the ocean. Observations from the field and remote-sensing platforms indicates that glaciers are sensitive to changes at the ice-ocean interface and that the increase in submarine melting is likely to be driven by the discharge of meltwater from underneath the glacier (known as subglacial meltwater plumes). The melting of glacier ice also directly inputs a large volume of freshwater into the ocean, potentially causing significant changes in the circulation of ocean waters which regulate the transport of heat on Earth, making ice-ocean interactions an important potential amplifier in climate change and variability. Our ability to predict, and hence adequately response to, climate change and sea level rise therefore depends on our knowledge of the small-scale processes occurring in the vicinity of subglacial meltwater plumes at the ice-ocean interface. Currently, our understanding of the underlying physics is incomplete; for example, different parameterizations of the glacial-ocean interaction could yield melting rates that vary over a factor of five for the same heat supply from the ocean. It is then very difficult to ascertain and judge the reliability of predictive models. We propose to use laboratory experiments to study how the melt rates of glaciers in the vicinity of plumes are affected by the ice roughness, ice geometry, and ocean turbulence at the ice-ocean interface.\n","date":1587590317,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587590317,"objectID":"c3376b7bec10e80bab30e69383704afe","permalink":"https://Lai-etal-lab.github.io/post/small-bets-award-2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T17:18:37-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/small-bets-award-2020/","section":"post","summary":"The project Like a knife through butter- glacial melt by ocean plumes investigated in novel laboratory experiments has been awarded the Small Bets Seed Grant 2020.

This creates flow anisotropy and favors motions along lines of constant density (isopycnals); the everyday smoke plume horizontally intruding into its surroundings is one example. Because of anisotropy, the pathways by which kinetic energy of the fluid motions is cascaded are also anisotropic and different than that predicted by classic turbulence theories. The goal of this project is to use high-resolution, volumetric velocity and density experimental data to improve the predictions of turbulent flows in the presence of stratification. Experiments will focus on canonical shear flows (jets, wakes, and mixing layers) and on two-layer stratified systems subject to homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) under different Brunt-Vaisala frequencies ($N^2$). Obtained data will be used to test existing RANS and LES turbulence closure models and to propose new model formulations.

Surface water enters the soil layer via infiltration and eventually becomes part of the groundwater flow. Apart from soil properties, the infiltration rate is highly dependent on the structures of the turbulent boundary layer adjacent to the porous bed. For sand beds with pore sizes of about 1mm, recent numerical studies found that the flow inside the pore matrix can become transitional and departs from the laminar Darcy flow regime; the Darcy coefficient is a function of the pore flow’s Reynolds number. Dispersion characteristics also change due to the change in flow regime. The project goal is to understand the different flow regimes and physics as a function of pore size and pore matrix using laboratory experiments. First part of the experimental program will focus on the effects of zero-mean flow, homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) created above the porous bed. Second part will study the effects of a turbulent channel flow. Refractive-index matching (RIM) techniques will be used to measure flows inside the pores and a random-jet stirred tank will be built to create HIT.\n","date":1575072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575072000,"objectID":"9c20425da5e4010dd144b54944ed1265","permalink":"https://Lai-etal-lab.github.io/project/turbulent-flow-in-porous-media/","publishdate":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/turbulent-flow-in-porous-media/","section":"project","summary":"Turbulent-laminar flow transitions in porous media-- solute transport in river and groundwater.","tags":["hyporheic mixing"],"title":"Turbulent flow in porous media","type":"project"}]
