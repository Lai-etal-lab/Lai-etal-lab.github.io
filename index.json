To fully characterize a turbulent flow thus requires the simultaneous measurements of the fluid velocity, density, and tracer mass distributions within a fluid volume at a sufficient spatial-temporal resolution. This is a non-trivial task for experimentalists because of the capital involved; it is estimated that between 8 to 12 high-speed cameras are required to do a full tomographic reconstruction of the velocity and scalar fields. Even when a high number of cameras is available, the physical constraints of a setup may preclude the deployment of such imaging system. To circumvent this technological barrier, I will present in the first part of this seminar a three-camera reconstruction method to obtain time-resolved, 3D fluid velocity and density data from planar data.\nIn the second part, I will change gear to discuss the similarities and differences on the interscale energy transfer in particle-laden and bubble-laden plumes. Examples of such plumes are found in subsea oil spills, in chemical mixing tanks, and in volcanic eruptions. Currently, our ability to predict their hydrodynamic behaviors is limited by our knowledge of the turbulence that exists in them. I will present combined experimental and numerical results to bridge this gap.\nAnnouncement link: https://pages.jh.edu/ceafm/weekly-seminar/Spring21/Lai.html.\n","date":1614052800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614052800,"objectID":"c547a5e45554e625e5b75a4d3905e4e9","permalink":"https://Lai-etal-lab.github.io/post/invited-talk-ceafm-2020spring/","publishdate":"2021-02-23T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/invited-talk-ceafm-2020spring/","section":"post","summary":"Tune in to the virtual seminar https://wse.zoom.us/j/93762992307 this Friday (Feb. 26, 2021) 3 pm EST.\nTitle: “Pseudo-Volumetric Reconstruction of Velocity and Density Fields from 2D Data \u0026amp; Energy Cascade in Multiphase Flows”","tags":[],"title":"Upcoming Seminar at Johns Hopkins Center for Environmental and Applied Fluid Mechanics","type":"post"},{"authors":["Chris CK Lai"],"categories":["Talk"],"content":"In this talk, I have presented the research from my on-going collaboration with colleagues in the Extreme Fluids Team at Los Alamos National Lab.

The non-negligible inertial differences between fluid parcels create the so-called mixing asymmetry; the hydrodynamics of a light fluid penetrating into a dense fluid is different from that of the dense fluid into the lighter one. Existing turbulence theories and models based on constant-density flows are inadequate when they are used to predict variable-density (VD) flows. Further, it becomes necessary to simultaneously measure density and velocity as the density is now an active scalar. The correlation between density fields and vortical structures is crucial in understanding the effects of fluid inertia on flow hydrodynamics. In this talk, we present an analytical and an experimental tool to study VD turbulence – (1) the generalization of the von Karman-Howarth-Monin (KHM) equation to include VD effects and (2) a three-camera reconstruction method to obtain time-resolved, 3D fluid velocity and density data from planar data. To illustrate the methods, we have applied them to analyze experimental datasets of a SF6 turbulent jet discharged into a coflowing air stream inside a wind tunnel; $\\rho_{2}/\\rho_{1} \\approx 4$ at the jet nozzle exit.\n","date":1605647917,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605647917,"objectID":"33cc585020014837b98c420aea16dc4d","permalink":"https://Lai-etal-lab.github.io/post/invited-talk-cfs-2020fall/","publishdate":"2020-11-17T17:18:37-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/invited-talk-cfs-2020fall/","section":"post","summary":"In this talk, I have presented the research from my on-going collaboration with colleagues in the Extreme Fluids Team at Los Alamos National Lab.

This is a collaboration with Dr. Alexander Robel from the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech. We are excited!\nHere is a synopsis-\nMelt from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are increasingly contributing to ongoing global sea level rise. This ice sheet mass loss is primarily driven by the thinning, retreat and acceleration of glaciers in contact with the ocean. Observations from the field and remote-sensing platforms indicates that glaciers are sensitive to changes at the ice-ocean interface and that the increase in submarine melting is likely to be driven by the discharge of meltwater from underneath the glacier (known as subglacial meltwater plumes). The melting of glacier ice also directly inputs a large volume of freshwater into the ocean, potentially causing significant changes in the circulation of ocean waters which regulate the transport of heat on Earth, making ice-ocean interactions an important potential amplifier in climate change and variability. Our ability to predict, and hence adequately response to, climate change and sea level rise therefore depends on our knowledge of the small-scale processes occurring in the vicinity of subglacial meltwater plumes at the ice-ocean interface. Currently, our understanding of the underlying physics is incomplete; for example, different parameterizations of the glacial-ocean interaction could yield melting rates that vary over a factor of five for the same heat supply from the ocean. It is then very difficult to ascertain and judge the reliability of predictive models. We propose to use laboratory experiments to study how the melt rates of glaciers in the vicinity of plumes are affected by the ice roughness, ice geometry, and ocean turbulence at the ice-ocean interface.\n","date":1587590317,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587590317,"objectID":"c3376b7bec10e80bab30e69383704afe","permalink":"https://Lai-etal-lab.github.io/post/small-bets-award-2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T17:18:37-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/small-bets-award-2020/","section":"post","summary":"The project Like a knife through butter- glacial melt by ocean plumes investigated in novel laboratory experiments has been awarded the Small Bets Seed Grant 2020.

For sand beds with pore sizes of about 1mm, recent numerical studies found that the flow inside the pore matrix can become transitional and departs from the laminar Darcy flow regime; the Darcy coefficient is a function of the pore flow’s Reynolds number.

Breakup dynamics transition from laminar to turbulent at a critical value of the Weber number. Very strong pure gas jets and most gas/liquid co-flowing jets exhibit atomization breakup. Bubble sizes in the atomization regime scale with the jet-to-plume transition length scale and follow −3/5 power-law scaling for a mixture Weber number.","tags":["Bubble size distribution","Gas bubble","Subsea oil well blowout","Particle breakup","Jet","Plume"],"title":"Behavior and dynamics of bubble breakup in gas pipeline leaks and accidental subsea oil well blowouts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris CK Lai","John J Charonko","Katherine Prestridge"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522108800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522108800,"objectID":"993cdd30e1f108442b17fc18f830834b","permalink":"https://Lai-etal-lab.github.io/publication/karmanhowarthmonin/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/karmanhowarthmonin/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a generalisation of the Kármán–Howarth–Monin (K–H–M) equation to include variable-density (VD) effects.

In these flows, one or more heterogeneous materials is/are transported by a turbulent carrier fluid (fluid, hereafter). Their interactions, as embodied in the fluid velocities, determine the final fate and transport of the heterogeneous materials. This dissertation investigates how turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is created and injected into surrounding fluid by the rising bubbles in an air-water bubble plume. This analogue flow shares many similar fluid mechanical properties with oil well blowout plumes whose knowledge is important in disaster management. A comprehensive experimental program using acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) and planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) has been carried out to measure fluid velocities inside the time-steady two-phase plume. Radial profiles of diffusion of TKE and turbulent dissipation rate are reported for the first time. From the fluid-phase TKE budget, it is found that approximately 55-60% of the total work done by bubbles is used to create turbulence in the carrier fluid. Results on the auto-spectral density function of velocity fluctuations reveal a -8/3 spectral slope instead of the classic Kolmogorov-Richardson value of -5/3, suggesting a fundamental difference in spectral energy transfer in this two-phase ow when compared to other simple boundary-layer shear flows, such as a singe-phase jet. This is supported by the subgrid scale (SGS) dissipation computed from the PIV data where it can be seen that the direction of energy cascade is always forward for a simple jet whereas it can be backward for the two-phase plume. On the other hand, a data interpolation method based on first-order autoregressive processes is developed to replace faulty or missing data in a time series of turbulent velocities. The method is shown to preserve both spectral slopes and energies of frequency components, for the range of slopes between -7/6 to -8/3. Further, the classical sample and hold interpolation is shown to be the limiting behavior of a first-order autoregressive process and therefore has theoretical underpinnings hitherto unknown in the literature.","tags":["Bubble plumes","two-phase flows","turbulence","energy cascade","velocity spectra","data interpolation"],"title":"An Analysis of Bubble Plumes in Unstratified Stagnant Water","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruño Fraga","Thorsten Stoesser","Chris CK Lai","Scott A Socolofsky"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1447113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1447113600,"objectID":"3c71054859d9870e991cd92dfa04a764","permalink":"https://Lai-etal-lab.github.io/publication/les-based/","publishdate":"2015-11-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/les-based/","section":"publication","summary":"An approach for Eulerian–Lagrangian large-eddy simulation of bubble plume dynamics is presented and its performance evaluated.","tags":["Bubble plumes","Large-eddy simulation","Lagrangian Particle Tracking","Two-way coupling","Slip velocity","Delta functions"],"title":"A LES-based Eulerian–Lagrangian approach to predict the dynamics of bubble plumes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["KW Choi","Chris CK Lai","Joseph HW Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1437436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437436800,"objectID":"33585b2644671b0500dedeb42fc8f4db","permalink":"https://Lai-etal-lab.github.io/publication/mixing-in-the-intermediate-field-of-dense-jets-in-cross-currents/","publishdate":"2015-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mixing-in-the-intermediate-field-of-dense-jets-in-cross-currents/","section":"publication","summary":"This study presents an experimental and numerical study for an inclined (60$^o$ to horizontal) dense jet discharged into a coflowing current.

Examples include brine discharge from desalination plants and cooled water from liquefied natural gas plants. In general, there exists an ambient current which can approach the jet at an arbitrary angle; the resulting dense jet will then have a three-dimensional trajectory. We present an experimental investigation on 60° dense jets discharged into a perpendicular current. The tracer concentration field is measured at selected cross-sections using the Laser induced-fluorescence (LIF) method. Jet detrainment from the dense jet is observed; the detrained jet fluid is advected horizontally downstream by the crossflow. Compared to predictions of a validated integral jet model that does not account for jet detrainment, it is found that the horizontal jet penetration in the momentum plane is consistently under-predicted by about 35 percent, while the jet trajectory in the buoyancy plane and the near field dilution in the bent-over dense jet are reasonably well-predicted.","tags":[],"title":"The Near-field Jet Behavior of 60° Dense Jets Discharged Into A Perpendicular Crossflow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris CK Lai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1260748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1260748800,"objectID":"595be2bf9bc85fdd2059bc12cba02d88","permalink":"https://Lai-etal-lab.github.io/publication/mixing-of-inclined-dense-jets/","publishdate":"2009-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mixing-of-inclined-dense-jets/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Mixing of Inclined Dense Jets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris CK Lai","Joseph HW Lee","KM Lam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"5a2695f58e1e6da89ad1171e1ed81f58","permalink":"https://Lai-etal-lab.github.io/publication/digital-simulation-of-dominant-eddies/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/digital-simulation-of-dominant-eddies/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper described a method for virtual construction of turbulent jet flow field from a limited set of experimental data. The objective is for jet visualization enhancement in near-field plume models. The method is based on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), which is an efficient tool to capture the turbulent field based on principal components. A set of experimental flow images at a number of cross-sections of a coflowing jet is obtained in the laboratory. Four hundred instantaneous flow images are taken at each jet section and are subjected to POD analysis. The first 60 principal modes are used in the reconstruction of jet turbulence via a low dimensional generation of jet images. The inclusion of additional modes is shown to produce little improvement on the visual appearance of the reconstructed jet images. Linear interpolation is attempted to generate jet images at an intermediate jet section between two experimental stations. Jet flow field on a central longitudinal section of the jet are assembled from the reconstructed flow images at all jet sections. The resulting development of concentration jet width is shown to agree well with the analytical solution.","tags":["proper orthogonal decomposition","POD","jet visualization","integral model"],"title":"Digital Simulation of Dominant Eddies of A Co-Flowing Jet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joseph HW Lee","Valiant Cheung","Chris CK Lai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1228089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1228089600,"objectID":"f60c56cdd1a686d78e2d2cf2cdf8264e","permalink":"https://Lai-etal-lab.github.io/publication/jetlag2008/","publishdate":"2008-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jetlag2008/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"JETLAG2008 - An Update","type":"publication"}]
